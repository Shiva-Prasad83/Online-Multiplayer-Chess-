      //Step 1: First thing is this Lobby Page is Accessed after user is logged in.
      //That means in userSlice user is there and isAuthenticated is true

      //Step 2: If the page is reloaded manually by user, userSlice is reset to default
      //that means now user is null and isAuthencated is false.

      //Step 3: On every reload we are hitting fetchMe end point from App.jsx
      //that updates the userSlice and again we got user from database and isAuthenticated is true again.
      
      // ***** Understand this *****//
      //Within the gap of the getting user from database by hitting fetchMe endpoint our redux userSlice
      //was updated or reset that means components using that userSlice state will re-render
      //Now we are on /lobby route within this gap my user is null and isAuthenticated is false.
      //So this component is re-render and if don't skip this re-render I will redirected to login page.
      //So to skip this re-render I'm checking if the isAuthenticated is false then show loading.
      //isAuthenticated becomes false in lobby when page reloads

      //After getting the response the fetchMe api endpoint, Again redux userSlice state is updated
      //So this component is using userSlice state so it re-renders.
      //Now user is there and isAuthenticated is true So we'll access this component.
